# Implementation_of_Flexcan

This repository contains an example project demonstrating the use of the FlexCAN module on the MIMXRT1170-EVK board. The project is implemented using the MCUXpresso SDK and IDE.

## Overview
This example initializes the FlexCAN module, configures it for communication, and demonstrates both transmitting and receiving CAN messages. The example continuously checks for received messages, prints their contents to the console, and sends a response back with the same data.
