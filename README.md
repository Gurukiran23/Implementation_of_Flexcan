# Implementation_of_Flexcan

This repository contains an example project demonstrating the use of the FlexCAN module on the MIMXRT1170-EVK board. The project is implemented using the MCUXpresso SDK and IDE.

## Overview
This example initializes the FlexCAN module, configures it for communication, and demonstrates both transmitting and receiving CAN messages. The example continuously checks for received messages, prints their contents to the console, and sends a response back with the same data.

## Prerequisites
MCUXpresso IDE: Installed on your development machine.
MCUXpresso SDK: Downloaded and installed for the MIMXRT1170-EVK.

## Hardware Setup:
MIMXRT1170-EVK board.
CAN transceiver (if not integrated).
CAN bus with terminating resistors.
PCAN Cable.

## Code Explanation
Includes and Definitions: Includes necessary headers and defines constants for CAN instance, clock frequency, message buffer numbers, interrupt vector, and CAN bitrate.
Variables: Declares variables for the FlexCAN handle, message buffers, and flags for transmission and reception completion.
FLEXCAN_UserCallback: Callback function to handle events such as message reception, transmission completion, and error conditions.
CAN_Init: Initializes the CAN module, sets up message buffers for transmission and reception, and enables interrupts.
Main Function:
Initializes board hardware and debug console.
Prints a start message.
Initializes the CAN module.
Prepares and continuously checks for received messages, prints their contents, and sends a response back.
